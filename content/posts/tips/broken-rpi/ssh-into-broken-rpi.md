# Context
I'm using Pi-Hole in a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W, and I have not installed any thermal pad or cooling paste on it. It rarely gets turned off and would not work for few minutes. Only, if I disconnect the power cable, leave it there for minutes and plugging it again will work. I was postponing to diagnose the device and yesterday it finally happened and I started digging in. 

I was searching the internet for any way to get SSH connection into the device, but I found no solution that utilized headless connection. Because, I don't have the type of HDMI cable that support the **Raspberry Pi Zero 2w**. So, I had to find a way to make it connect to the new network without deleting the data inside it.
