# Why Open Source?
Well, why not? 

_I like open source applications and I prefer using them over monopolized, propreitary or closed-source applications. I want to break the cyle and inspire people to use alternative and support FOSS in every possible way_.

> _besides I'm an open-source/FOSS enthusiast + a nerd (hehe)_ 

## 1. [`droid-ify`](https://github.com/Droid-ify/client) - F-Droid client with Material UI

This is like a play-store for **Open-Source** applications. Finding the applications is a breeze!
I have listed it because the downstream is easy after installing this application.
> Most of the applications listed here will be easily downloaded using this application.

## 2. [`FFUpdater`](https://github.com/Tobi823/ffupdater) - Updater for privacy focussed open-source browsers.
List of privacy-focussed or open-source applications are listed here. It will update/install the applications from the source. 

_I like `chromite` tho :P_

## 3. [`bitwarden mobile`](https://github.com/bitwarden/mobile) - Password Manager

Well, now you'll need the crendentials to login and that's where `bitwarden` comes in. Generate strong passwords with in-build _Password Generator_ and store the passwords in there. Also you can store ssh keys, notes, cards and more.
